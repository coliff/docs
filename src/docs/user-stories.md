# User Stories

I propose that one of our starting points should be to nail down the "value proposition" of the journal. Why would someone (a researcher, academic, or software developer) want to "use" this journal? And why would they want to use this journal rather than some other journal? I think once we figure out what the purpose of the journal is, we will find it easier to nail down the details like what a submission, review process, and editorial board for the journal looks like.

From my perspective, there are: (1) Traditional journals that review/publish research and theory papers. Embedded within these traditional-journal papers are methods sections that describe any software used, if applicable, and it is the rare savvy researcher who links/cites the software. But reproducing the software used in a traditional-journal experiment is often a massive undertaking of reverse-engineering with a lot of room for error. This is a problem for reproducibility, not to mention how much it may slow down scientific progress. Then there is (2) JOSS, which reviews / publishes research software, with an exclusive focus on software to the exclusion of research / analyses. There is no option (3) A journal that reviews / publishes software for running qualitative / quantitative experiments, which reviews both the software and the research to test the software. (Think: Software for paradigms like the Stroop, N-Back, Flanker, IAT.)

To formalize the value prop, we could try an approach from agile development: user stories.

Who are our users, and what do these "user stories" look like?

I think our users are primarily: (1) Researchers, (2) Academics, and (3) Software Developers. Although it's not a clear distinction, we can distinguish "Researcher" from "Academic" by whether they are interested in creating and publishing new knowledge (whatever form that takes).

I'll start with my own user stories.

As a Researcher, I want a place where I can go to find software for running commonly-used cognitive or behavioral paradigms on the web. I want this software to be tested, validated, and peer-reviewed.
As a Researcher, I want a place where I can go to find (anonymized) data from experiments that have been run with this software, so I can cross-validate / diagnose / troubleshoot when I use the software myself.
As a Software Developer, I want a place where I can publish new experiment software that I have created for researchers to use.
As an Academic, I want a place where I can publish (anonymized) data and results / analyses from studies to validate or norm new experiment software.
