# Open Bases

An open base template is a combination of components, including experiment
templates, testing tools, and deployment options to produce a full development
through publication reproducible workflow.

```
develop --> version control --> build --> test --> deploy --> publish
```

## Templates

Each of the following is a builder template, typically including all steps to
help you with development through deployment and publication.


!!! info "Labjs Builder"
    Build your experiment with the LabJS builder interface, and export it into a Github 
    repository that is ready to be connected to CircleCI and Docker Hub to build, deploy, 
    and publish your experiment in the Journal of Open Research Experiments.

!!! info "JsPsych Builder"
    Build your experiment with the JsPsych builder interface, and export it into a Github 
    repository that is ready to be connected to CircleCI and Docker Hub to build, deploy, 
    and publish your experiment in the Journal of Open Research Experiments.

!!! info "Expfactory Builder"
    Start with an experiment from the Experiment Factory Library, and add it to a Github
    repository to connect to CircleCI and Docker Hub to build, deploy, 
    and publish your experiment in the Journal of Open Research Experiments.
